# 09 Good README Generator

Create a command-line application that dynamically generates a README.md from a user's input. The application will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```

The user will be prompted for their GitHub username, which will be used to make a call to the GitHub API to retrieve their email and profile image. They will then be prompted with questions about their project.

## Completed
* The generated README includes the following sections: 
  * Title
  * Description
  * Table of Contents
  * Installation
  * Usage
  * License
  * Contributing
  * Tests
  * Questions

* The generated README includes 1 badge that's specific to the repository.
